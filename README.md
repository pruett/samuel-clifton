Hi family,

I came upon Pop-pop’s autobiography close to a year ago and really enjoyed it. I’m not sure if everyone had a chance to read it, or even knew of its existence, so I wanted to share it just in case.

I’m not sure how many copies of it are circulating. My dad gave me his copy, which consisted of 25 or so pages, printed out on what I assume to be an older computer as the pages have a unique typeface and letter spacing that you don’t see too often; almost reminiscent of a typewriter.

Anyways, I transcribed the pages and put it online for anyone who is interested. Aunt Sandee and Aunt Carol provided me with some old photos of Pop-pop and the family which I threw in there as well. Thanks!

I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did. I hope the online medium doesn’t obscure the level of intimacy I felt when reading the physical copy that Pop-pop printed and assembled himself.

What you’ll see is an unedited transcription of his unfinished autobiography. Please forward this along to friends, family, relatives, etc.
